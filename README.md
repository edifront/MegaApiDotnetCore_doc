Mega Man Robots API Documentation
Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Mega Man Robots API, a .NET Core web API designed to serve JSON-formatted data about bosses from the Mega Man series. The API leverages Entity Framework Core for robust data management and adheres to RESTful API design principles to ensure clear and effective communication between clients and the server.
Technologies Used
 * ASP.NET Core 3.1: The web application framework that underpins the API's development.
 * Entity Framework Core (EF Core): An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that simplifies interaction with relational databases.
 * RESTful API Design: A set of architectural guidelines for creating web APIs that emphasize clear resource identification, standard HTTP verbs, and predictable response formats.
 * Dependency Injection: A software design pattern that promotes loose coupling and facilitates unit testing.
API Endpoints
The Mega Man Robots API offers the following endpoints for accessing robot data:
 * GET /api/v1/robots: Retrieves a list of all robots in the database.
 * GET /api/v1/robots/{id}: Returns details of a specific robot identified by its unique ID.
 * POST /api/v1/robots: Creates a new robot entry in the database.
Data Model
The API revolves around the Robot model, which represents a boss character from the Mega Man universe. The model typically includes properties such as:
 * Id (int): Unique identifier of the robot.
 * Name (string): Name of the robot.
 * Debut (string): Game in which the robot first appeared.
 * Weapon (string): Weapon wielded by the robot.
 * Weakness (string): Weapon or strategy particularly effective against the robot.
 * Description (string): Optional textual description of the robot.
Error Handling
The API adheres to standard HTTP status codes to communicate errors. Common examples include:
 * 200 OK: The request was successful.
 * 400 Bad Request: The request was invalid due to malformed data or missing parameters.
 * 404 Not Found: The requested resource (e.g., a robot with a specific ID) could not be found.
 * 500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server side.
Security Considerations
While this documentation focuses on the API's functionality, security is a critical aspect of any web application. Implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms is essential to protect the API from unauthorized access and data manipulation.
Deployment
The Mega Man Robots API can be deployed to various hosting environments that support ASP.NET Core applications. Common options include on-premises servers, cloud platforms like Azure or AWS, and containerization technologies like Docker.
Conclusion
The Mega Man Robots API provides a well-structured and documented interface for accessing data about Mega Man robots. It leverages modern web development technologies and adheres to best practices for API design. By understanding the concepts outlined in this document, developers can effectively interact with the API to retrieve, create, or update robot information.
